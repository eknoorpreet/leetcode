/*

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:

i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
s[j] == '0'.
Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.



Example 1:

Input: s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: true
Explanation:
In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3.
In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.

Example 2:

Input: s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3
Output: false

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
s[0] == '0'
1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} minJump
 * @param {number} maxJump
 * @return {boolean}
 */

/*

Constraints:

Our jump should be within bounds
We should land at '0'

Core Intuition:

Use BFS to explore all possible jumps from each reachable position
For each position, explore jumps within [minJump, maxJump] range

Approach Without Optimization:
From current index i, we can jump to any index in range [i + minJump, i + maxJump]
Without optimization, we'd check every possible index in this range

Why It's Inefficient:
For each position i:
    Checks all positions from i + minJump to i + maxJump
    Range could be as large as n
    Same positions get added to queue multiple times
    Results in O(nÂ²) time complexity

Example:
Let's say minJump = 2, maxJump = 4

At index 3:

Reachable range: [5, 7] (3+2 to 3+4)
All these indices get queued

At index 4:

Reachable range: [6, 8] (4+2 to 4+4)
Problem: Indices 6,7 were already checked from index 3!

Why BFS over DFS?

BFS explores positions level by level
Better for finding shortest path
More efficient for this problem as we want to reach the end with minimum jumps

/*

The Optimization:

Keep track of farthestReach
When processing index 4:

Instead of checking from [4+2, 4+4]
Check from [max(4+2, farthestReach+1), 4+4] (Actually, in the end boundary, ensure you don't go out of bounds). Therefore, [max(4+2, farthestReach+1), min(4+4, s.length)]
This skips already processed indices
