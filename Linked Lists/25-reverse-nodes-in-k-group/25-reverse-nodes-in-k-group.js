/*

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 5000
0 <= Node.val <= 1000

/*

Time Complexity:

The main part of the algorithm involves reversing each sublist of size k for a total of
numberOfReversals times. Reversing each sublist of size k takes O(k) time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(numberOfReversals Ã— k).
But, numberOfReversals = n / k. So, numberOfReversals * k = n. Hence, overall O(n).

Space Complexity: O(1)
