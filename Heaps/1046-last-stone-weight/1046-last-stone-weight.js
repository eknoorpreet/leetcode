/*

Explanation:

Why second <= largest and not second != largest ? In the second method, if we have [2, 2],
we smash them and now the max heap is empty but we need to return 2.
Then, we need to do maxHeap.peek() ?? 0 .
To avoid that, we can use the first method and add 0s to the heap as well.

/*
  Time Complexity:
  The insertion into the min heap takes O(log n) time for each element, and since there are n elements in the nums array, the time complexity is O(n * log n).

  The extractMax also takes takes O(log n) for each element and and since there are n elements in the nums array, the time complexity is O(n * log n).

  Space Complexity:
  The space used by the min heap is proportional to the number of elements inserted from stones nums array. In the worst case, when all elements from the stones array are inserted, the space complexity for the min heap is O(n).
