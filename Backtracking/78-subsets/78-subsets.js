/*

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible
subsets
 (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
All the numbers of nums are unique.

 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[][]}

/*

Use backtracking to generate all possible subsets by making two key decisions for each element:

Include the current element in the subset
Exclude the current element from the subset

/*

Time Complexity: O(2^n)

Each iteration doubles the number of subsets
Total subsets: 2^n

Space Complexity: O(n)

"Each iteration doubles the number of subsets"

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

Initialization:
The process starts with result = [[]], which contains a single subset, the empty subset.
For Each Number n in nums:

The current subsets are iterated over.
For every existing subset, a new subset is created by copying the subset and adding the current number n.

Doubling Effect:
Before processing a number n, let the number of subsets in result be 'size'. For each of these 'size'
subsets, a new subset is created that includes n.
This means the number of subsets after processing n becomes size + size (original subsets + newly
created subsets), effectively doubling the total subsets.

Example Walkthrough:

Let nums = [1, 2, 3].
Iteration 1 (Add 1):

Start with result = [[]].
Add 1 to each existing subset:
New subsets: [1].
result = [[], [1]] (2 subsets).
Iteration 2 (Add 2):

Start with result = [[], [1]].
Add 2 to each existing subset:
New subsets: [2] (from []) and [1, 2] (from [1]).
result = [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]] (4 subsets).
